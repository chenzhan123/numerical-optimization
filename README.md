# numerical-optimization

The package is used to do numerical optimization. This package contains some popular methods

Description:

linear_search: contains some linear search methods. e.g. Backtrack、interpolation

search: contains some unlinear search methods. e.g. Netown、quasi-Newton、conjugate

optimal: do convex optimization with unconstraint、linear constraint or unlinear constraint

test: do some test

Note:

you better input numpy.array type data, otherwise it may raise an error
